# Speeches and Newspaper articles relating to suffrage
### The Process
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I located some newspapers handily sourced from archives & newspapers.com. From there, I scraped the sites to get a plain text version that can be analyzed by Orange. After the webscrape, the data was collected and input into a fairly massive excel document so I could analyze everything at once. After cleaning up a few "unusable" entries via filter (usually an offhand mention of the word "woman" that would come up in a search but bear no relevance to suffrage or rights).

### The Result
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visualizations posted here are the result of the research and scrape. While traditional research would allow me to hone in on a single subject like a person or a location, the strength of digital techniques is that I can clear large swathes of metaphorical ground so long as the sources are digitized or composed in a way that can be analyzed by a program.
